# Noah Morgan Portfolio

## Portfolio Discption

This purpose of this porfolio is to create a website to showcase your current and upcoming skills that have and will be learnt in the Coder Academy course. The goal for this website was to have something that is easy to navigate and read through but also look well thought out, stylish and have few animations through out

## Target Audience
The target audience for the project and website is any future employers. I hope to show my skills that I've developed and the skills that i learn and pick-up along the way. I also intend to keep using the website and updating it as mt portfolio increases
